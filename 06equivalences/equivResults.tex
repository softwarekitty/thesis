\section{Frequency analysis results}
\input{table/nodeCount}

Table~\ref{table:nodeCount} presents the frequencies with which each representation appears in a regex pattern and in a project scraped from GitHub. The \emph{node} column references the representations in Figure~\ref{fig:refactoringTree} and the \emph{description} column briefly describes the representation, followed by an \emph{example} from the corpus. The \emph{nPatterns} column counts the patterns that belong to the representation, followed by the percent of patterns out of 13,597.
The \emph{nProjects} column counts the projects that contain a regex belonging to the representation,
followed by the percentage of projects out of 1,544.
Recall that the patterns are all unique and could appear in multiple projects, hence the project support is used to show how pervasive the representation in across the whole community.
For example, 2,479 of the patterns belong to the C1 representation, representing 18.2\% of the patterns. These appear in 810 projects, representing 52.5\%.
Representation D1 appears in 346 (2.5\%) of the patterns but only 234 (15.2\%) of the projects. In contrast, representation T3 appears in 39 \emph{fewer} patterns but 34 \emph{more} projects, indicating that D1 is more concentrated in a few projects and T3 is more widespread across projects.
