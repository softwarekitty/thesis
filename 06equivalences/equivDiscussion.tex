\section{Discussion of representation frequency analysis}

Using the pattern frequency as a guide, we can create refactoring recommendations based on community frequency. For example, since C1 is more prevalent than C2, we could say that C2 is smelly since it could better conform to the community standard if expressed as C1. Thus, we might recommend a $\overrightarrow{C2C1}$ refactoring. Based on patterns alone, the winning representations per equivalence class are C1, D2, T1, L2, and S2. With one exception, these are the same for recommendations based on projects. The difference is that L3 appears in more projects than L2, so it is not clear which is more desirable based on community standards.
