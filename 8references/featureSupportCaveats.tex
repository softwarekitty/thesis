\section*{Caveats to consider when comparing feature sets}
\label{sec:featureSupportCaveats}
Variation among supported feature sets is not easy to define concisely.  Often the same feature is essentially supported, but nuances exist so that the exact behavior of the feature still varies enough to have an effect on code that relies on regexes using that feature.  One example of this is the OPT feature (e.g., \cverb!(?i)cAsE!), for which different engines have different sets of options.  Python's set of 7 options is small compared to Tcl which has 15 or so.  In Table~\ref{table:rankedFeatureSupport} if the following 3 core options are supported: \cverb!(?ism)!, then the variant will be shown as having that feature.  However in all other cases, to the best knowledge of the author, a strict view is taken when considering if two variants support the same feature - it should have the exact same syntax and behavior in order for the feature to be considered the same feature in two variants.  Documentation of engines varies in detail and quality, so that often the particular behavioral details and full feature set is only known to developers of the engine.  In this attempt to document some of the variations in feature support, no attempt is made to address these minor nuances and tricky details, but instead the focus is on documenting the presence or absence of features at a high level.
