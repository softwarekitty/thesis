These nodes and their average number of unsure responses are organized by quartile in Table~\ref{table:unsureResults}.
These results also corroborate the refactorings suggested by the understandability analysis for the LIT group (i.e., $\overrightarrow{T4 T1}$), the DBB group (i.e.,  $\overrightarrow{D2 D3}$), and the LWB group (i.e., $\overrightarrow{L2 L3}$) because the more understandable node has the least unsures of its group.
The findings for D3 and D2 are contradictory, however, as  and further study is needed, and the number of unsures may be too small to indicate anything, except for T2 and T4.  The one pattern from T4 that had the most unsures of any pattern (i.e., 10 out of 30) was \verb!`xyz[\0133-\0140]'!, so this may have been the least understandable pattern that we tested.
