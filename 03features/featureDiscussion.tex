\section{Discussion of utilization and feature analysis results}
\label{sec:featureDiscussion}

\subsection{Implications}
Think about the part of all regex that use any back-references and so are not representing regular languages (vs those that are).
\subsection{Opportunities for future work}

\subsubsection{Alternative techniques for building a corpus}
\label{sec:alternateCorpus}
any number of different regular expression languages like Perl Regular Expressions, Java Regular Expressions or .Net Regular Expressions.  Also independent of the regular expression language, the regexes studied could come from a variety of sources like sourceforge, bitbucket, a private repository, or even from github using a different technique than the one used to build the corpus (described in


\subsection{Threats to validity}
