\section{Discussion of utilization and feature analysis results}
\label{sec:featureDiscussion}

\subsection{Implications}
Think about the part of all regex that use any back-references and so are not representing regular languages (vs those that are).
\subsection{Opportunities for future work}

\subsubsection{Alternative techniques for building a corpus}
\label{sec:alternateCorpus}
any number of different regular expression languages like Perl Regular Expressions, Java Regular Expressions or .Net Regular Expressions.  Also independent of the regular expression language, the regexes studied could come from a variety of sources like sourceforge, bitbucket, a private repository, or even from github using a different technique than the one used to build the corpus (described in


\subsection{Threats to validity}



The eight most commonly used features, ADD, CG, KLE, CCC, ANY, RNG, STR and END,
appear in over half the projects.
CG is more commonly used in patterns than the highest ranked feature (ADD) by a wide margin (over 8\%), even though they appear in similar numbers of projects.



% The eight most common features are found in over 50\% of the projects.
% Shown in Table~\ref{table:featureStats}, the STR and END features are present in over half of the scanned projects containing utilizations.  In our survey, over half (56\%) of the respondents answered that they use endpoint anchors frequently or very frequently, and none of them claimed to never use them.

% The LZY feature  is present in over 36\% of scanned projects with utilizations, and yet was not supported by two of the four major regex projects we explored, brics and RE2.
% In our developer survey, 11\% (2) of participants use this feature frequently and 6 (33\%) use it occasionally, showing a modest impact on potential users.

% When survey participants were asked if they prefer to always use numbered (BKR) or named (BKRN) back references, 66\% (12) of survey participants said that they always use BKR, and the remaining 33\% (6) said ``it depends."  No participants preferred named capture groups.  BKR is present in 5\% of scanned projects, while BKRN is present in only 1.7\%, which corroborates our findings that numbered  are generally preferred over named capture groups.
