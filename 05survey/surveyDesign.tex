\section{Survey design based on feature analysis}

To understand the context of when and how programmers use regular expressions,
we designed a survey, implemented using Google Forms, with 40 questions. The questions asked about regex usage frequency, languages, purposes, pain points, and the use of various language
features.

Participation was voluntary and participants were entered in a lottery for a \$50 gift card.

Our goal was to understand the practices of professional developers. Thus, we deployed the survey to 22 professional developers at Dwolla, a small software company that provides tools for online and mobile payment management. While this sample comes from a single company, we note anecdotally that Dwolla is a start-up and most of the developers worked previously for other software companies, and thus bring their past experiences with them. Surveyed developers have nine years of experience, on average, indicating the results may generalize beyond a single, small software company, but further study is needed.
