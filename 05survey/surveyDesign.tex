\section{Survey design based on feature analysis}

To understand the context of when and how programmers use regular expressions,
a survey was designed and implemented using Google Forms containing 30 questions~\ref{fig:surveyPDF1}. The questions asked about regex usage frequency, technical environment, tasks regexes were used for, pain points, and the use of various language
features.
Participation was voluntary and participants were entered in a lottery for a \$50 gift card.

The goal of the survey was to understand the practices of professional developers. Thus, the survey was deployed to 22 professional developers at Dwolla, a small software company that provides tools for online and mobile payment management. While this sample comes from a single company, we note anecdotally that Dwolla is a start-up and most of the developers worked previously for other software companies, and thus bring their past experiences with them. Surveyed developers have nine years of experience, on average, indicating the results may generalize beyond a single, small software company, but further study is needed.
