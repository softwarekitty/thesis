\section{Basic concepts about regex}


\todoNow{CLEAN THIS AND FULLY DESCRIBE FEATURES AND THE BASIC TERMS WE WILL USE TO DESCRIBE ORDINARY CONCEPTS}
OK so you've never seen a regex before?  Keyword search?  Lame, try abstracting one or two characters.  And what if you want to capture some numbers, or maybe it's okay to repeat something a few times.  Specific number of times?  Okay that's great.  There are 1001 introductions to regex out there, it kind of makes me feel ill just how often this wheel is re-cast. But here we go again.


Great, now that that's done, here is how we are going to refer to the features of modern regex:
\input{table/featureDescriptions}

Now that you have that table, let's go through it feature-by-feature and really describe the hell out of these.  Got to do that first, really, since we have to talk about when these are introduced right away, and what features break the equivalence with DFAs, and why etc.  And then boy we are going to refer to this a million times in the experimentation sections.

Language theorists are interested in regular expressions that describe languages, and so they use the intersection and union operator, and take special care to formalize how the empty string is handled and relates to their algebreic operations.  We have great respect for the power of these theories, but will not rely much on them because they ignore backreferences, etc....
