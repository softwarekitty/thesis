\section{Structure of thesis}
 \todoMid{Organize Sections and references}
This thesis will begin by introducing fundamental concepts, feature descriptions and basic usage of regular expressions (regex), followed by a summary of historical milestones and introduction of terminology.  To convey the scope of impact that research into regex has, some examples of where regex are used and studied will be provided.  Armed with this overview, the main questions that this thesis will explore and their motivations will be introduced, followed by a section on similar and related exploratory work.  The next \todoLast{N} sections will detail the studies conducted to explore the research questions of this thesis.  Each of these sections will consist of a description of how the study was designed, results of the study, and a discussion of implications and opportunities for future work.  Each section describing an experiment may depend on the results of previous sections.  A final discussion will highlight the most important implications and opportunities for future work already presented, as well as any additional implications or future work not mentioned elsewhere.  After a conclusion summarizing everything that has been presented, an appendix of artifacts and a bibliography will complete the thesis.
