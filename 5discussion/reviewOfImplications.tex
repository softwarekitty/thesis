\section{Review Of Implications}


The most frequently performed task according to Table~\ref{table:regextasks} is `locating content within a file or files'.  This result agrees with the idea that regexes are used more often in text editors and command line tools than in general purpose languages, since locating content is often done within a text editor.



The eight most common features are found in over 50\% of the projects.
Shown in Table~\ref{table:featureStatsOnly}, the STR and END features are present in over half of the scanned projects containing utilizations.  In our survey, over half (56\%) of the respondents answered that they use endpoint anchors frequently or very frequently, and none of them claimed to never use them.

The LZY feature  is present in over 36\% of scanned projects with utilizations, and yet was not supported by two of the four major regex projects we explored, brics and RE2.
In our developer survey, 11\% (2) of participants use this feature frequently and 6 (33\%) use it occasionally, showing a modest impact on potential users.
