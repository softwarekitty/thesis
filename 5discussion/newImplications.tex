\section{Additional Implications}

% The eight most common features are found in over 50\% of the projects.
% Shown in Table~\ref{table:featureStats}, the STR and END features are present in over half of the scanned projects containing utilizations.  In our survey, over half (56\%) of the respondents answered that they use endpoint anchors frequently or very frequently, and none of them claimed to never use them.

% The LZY feature  is present in over 36\% of scanned projects with utilizations, and yet was not supported by two of the four major regex projects we explored, brics and RE2.
% In our developer survey, 11\% (2) of participants use this feature frequently and 6 (33\%) use it occasionally, showing a modest impact on potential users.

% When survey participants were asked if they prefer to always use numbered (BKR) or named (BKRN) back references, 66\% (12) of survey participants said that they always use BKR, and the remaining 33\% (6) said ``it depends."  No participants preferred named capture groups.  BKR is present in 5\% of scanned projects, while BKRN is present in only 1.7\%, which corroborates our findings that numbered  are generally preferred over named capture groups.

 It depends, but IMHO the capture group really shines in programming-language use, because captured content can be put into a variable and used later.

 Simple matching that requires the whole string to match seems less useful - unless we are validating user input.


 I use split all the time, usually splitting on a comma or tab, but this needs to be flexable, why not regex?  This qualifies as worthwhile for future work.
