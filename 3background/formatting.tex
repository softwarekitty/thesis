This thesis will explore many details involving characters, strings and regexes.  To reduce confusion due to typesetting issues, and to avoid repeatedly qualifying quoted text with phrases like `the string' or `the regex', characters will be surrounded in single quotes like \verb!`c'!, strings will be surrounded by double quotes like \verb!"example string"!, and regexes will be presented within a grey box without any quotes like \cverb!a+b*(c|d)e\1f!.  All strings in this thesis should be considered `raw' strings - where in Python and Java source code a literal backslash in a string variable must be escaped so that two backslashes are necessary, only one will be shown in the text of this thesis.  This means that a string presented in this thesis like \verb!"a\dc"! would actually be \verb!"a\\dc"! in source code.  Invisible characters such as newline will be represented within strings in gray,
like \verb!"first line.!\gverb!\n!\verb!second line."!.
