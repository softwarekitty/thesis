\subsection{Bracket parsers}
One category of clusters, \emph{Content of Brackets and Parenthesis}, parses the contents of angle brackets, which may indicate developers are using regexes to parse HTML or XML.  As the contents of angle brackets are usually unconstrained, regexes are a poor replacement for XML or HTML parsers.  This may be a missed opportunity for the regex users to take advantage of more robust tools. More research is needed into how regex users discover best practices and how aware they are of how regexes should and should not be used.
