\subsubsection{Ephemeral regex exploration}
In some environments, such as command line or text editor, regexes are used extensively by the surveyed developers (Section\todoLast{N}), but these regular expressions do not persist. Thus, using a repository analysis for feature usage only illustrates part of how regexes are used in practice. Exploring how the feature usage differs between environments would help inform tool developers about how to best support regex usage in context, and is left for future work.
