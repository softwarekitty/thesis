  abstract = {<p>Automated program repair can potentially reduce debugging
  costs and improve software quality but recent studies have drawn attention
  to shortcomings in the quality of automatically generated repairs. We
  propose a new kind of repair that uses the large body of existing
  open-source code to find potential fixes. The key challenges lie in
  efficiently finding code semantically similar (but not identical) to
  defective code and then appropriately integrating that code into a buggy
  program. We present SearchRepair, a repair technique that addresses these
  challenges by (1) encoding a large database of human-written code fragments
  as SMT constraints on input-output behavior, (2) localizing a given defect
  to likely buggy program fragments and deriving the desired input-output
  behavior for code to replace those fragments, (3) using state-of-the-art
  constraint solvers to search the database for fragments that satisfy that
  desired behavior and replacing the likely buggy code with these potential
  patches, and (4) validating that the patches repair the bug against program
  test suites. We find that SearchRepair repairs 150 (19%) of 778 benchmark C
  defects written by novice students, 20 of which are not repaired by
  GenProg, TrpAutoRepair, and AE. We compare the quality of the patches
  generated by the four techniques by measuring how many independent,
  not-used-during-repair tests they pass, and find that SearchRepair-repaired
  programs pass 97.3% of the tests, on average, whereas GenProg-,
  TrpAutoRepair-, and AE-repaired programs pass 68.7%, 72.1%, and 64.2% of
  the tests, respectively. We conclude that SearchRepair produces
  higher-quality repairs than GenProg, TrpAutoRepair, and AE, and repairs
  some defects those tools cannot. </p>},

@article{Kitchen2703,
	Abstract = {The evolution of languages provides a unique opportunity to study human population history. The origin of Semitic and the nature of dispersals by Semitic-speaking populations are of great importance to our understanding of the ancient history of the Middle East and Horn of Africa. Semitic populations are associated with the oldest written languages and urban civilizations in the region, which gave rise to some of the world{\textquoteright}s first major religious and literary traditions. In this study, we employ Bayesian computational phylogenetic techniques recently developed in evolutionary biology to analyse Semitic lexical data by modelling language evolution and explicitly testing alternative hypotheses of Semitic history. We implement a relaxed linguistic clock to date language divergences and use epigraphic evidence for the sampling dates of extinct Semitic languages to calibrate the rate of language evolution. Our statistical tests of alternative Semitic histories support an initial divergence of Akkadian from ancestral Semitic over competing hypotheses (e.g. an African origin of Semitic). We estimate an Early Bronze Age origin for Semitic approximately 5750 years ago in the Levant, and further propose that contemporary Ethiosemitic languages of Africa reflect a single introduction of early Ethiosemitic from southern Arabia approximately 2800 years ago.},

	Abstract = {{Because of the  '' all-or-none'' character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.}},

	Abstract = {Today, software systems that rely on data are ubiquitous, and
  ensuring the data's quality is an increasingly important challenge as data
  errors result in annual multi-billion dollar losses. While software
  debugging and testing have received heavy research attention, less effort
  has been devoted to data debugging: identifying system errors caused by
  well-formed but incorrect data. We present continuous data testing (CDT), a
  low-overhead, delay-free technique that quickly identifies likely data
  errors. CDT continuously executes domain-specific test queries; when a test
  fails, CDT unobtrusively warns the user or administrator. We implement CDT
  in the ConTest prototype for the PostgreSQL database management system. A
  feasibility user study with 96 humans shows that ConTest was extremely
  effective in a setting with a data entry application at guarding against
  data errors: With ConTest, users corrected 98.4% of their errors, as
  opposed to 40.2% without, even when we injected 40% false positives into
  ConTest's output. Further, when using ConTest, users corrected data entry
  errors 3.2 times faster than when using state-of-the-art methods.},

@inproceedings{Smith15fse,
	Abstract = {<p>Recent research in automated program repair has shown
  promise for reducing the significant manual effort debugging requires. This
  paper addresses a deficit of earlier evaluations of automated repair
  techniques caused by repairing programs and evaluating generated patches'
  correctness using the same set of tests. Since tests are an imperfect
  metric of program correctness, evaluations of this type do not discriminate
  between correct patches, and patches that overfit the available tests and
  break untested but desired functionality. This paper evaluates two
  well-studied repair tools, GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, on a 956-bug dataset,
  each with a human-written patch. By evaluating patches on tests independent
  from those used during repair, we find that the tools are unlikely to
  improve the proportion of independent tests passed, and that the quality of
  the patches is proportional to the coverage of the test suite used during
  repair. For programs with fewer bugs, the tools are as likely to break
  tests as to fix them. However, novice developers also overfit, and
  automated repair can, under the right conditions, outperform these
  developers. In addition to overfitting, we measure the effects of test
  suite coverage, test suite provenance, starting program quality, and the
  difference in quality between novice-developer-written and tool-generated
  patches when quality is assessed with an independent test suite from patch
  generation. We have released the 956-bug dataset to allow future
  evaluations of new repair tools.</p>},

	Abstract = {Most existing software tools and environments help developers
  analyze the present and past development states of their software systems,
  but few approaches have investigated the potential consequences of
  \emph{future} actions the developers may perform. The commoditization of
  hardware, multi-core architectures, and cloud computing provide new
  potential for delivering apparently-instantaneous feedback to developers,
  informing them of the effects of changes to the software that they may be
  considering.

  For example, modern IDEs often provide ``quick fix'' suggestions for
  resolving compilation errors. Developers must scan this list and select the
  option they think will resolve the problem. Instead, we propose that the IDE
  should speculatively perform each of the suggestions and provide information
  that helps developers select the best option for the given context. We
  believe the feedback enabled by speculative operations can lead to increased
  developer productivity and software quality.},

	Abstract = {Collaborative development can be hampered when conflicts arise
  because developers have inconsistent copies of a shared project. We present
  an approach to help developers identify and resolve conflicts early, before
  those conflicts become severe and before relevant changes fade away in the
  developers' memories. This paper presents three results.

  First, a study of open-source systems establishes that conflicts are
  frequent, persistent, and appear not only as overlapping textual edits but
  also as subsequent build and test failures. The study spans nine open-source
  systems totaling 3.4 million lines of code; our conflict data is derived
  from 550,000 development versions of the systems.

  Second, using previously-unexploited information, we precisely diagnose
  important classes of conflicts using the novel technique of speculative
  analysis over version control operations.

  Third, we describe the design of Crystal, a publicly-available tool that
  uses speculative analysis to make concrete advice unobtrusively available to
  developers, helping them identify, manage, and prevent conflicts.},

@inproceedings{Muslu12oopsla,
	Abstract = {Modern integrated development environments recommend and
  automate common tasks, such as refactorings, auto-completions, and error
  corrections. However, these tools present little or no information about the
  consequences of the recommended changes. For example, a rename refactoring
  may: (1) modify the source code without changing program semantics, (2)
  modify the source code and (incorrectly) change program semantics, (3)
  modify the source code and (incorrectly) create compilation errors, (4) show
  a name collision warning and require developer input, or (5) show an error
  and not change the source code. Having to compute the consequences of a
  recommendation --- either mentally or by making source code changes --- puts
  an extra burden on the developers.
  
  This paper aims to reduce this burden with a technique that informs
  developers of the consequences of code transformations. Taking Eclipse Quick
  Fix as an example, we build a plug-in, Quick Fix Scout, that computes the
  consequences of Quick Fix recommendations. Our experiments with 20 users
  demonstrate that developers complete compilation-error removal tasks 10%
  faster when using Quick Fix Scout than Eclipse's Quick Fix.},
