\section{Applications Of Regex}
A variety of applications for regular expressions is explored in this section.

\subsection{End user applications}
\paragraph{Find and replace utility}
The task for which regular expressions were first implemented is finding and replacing strings in blocks of text.  This remains a central application for regular expressions, which programmers can use in a surprising number of ways to save effort.  Utilities provided by text editors such as Emacs, Notepad++, Sublime Text and Eclipse include: incremental find and replace within a single file, batch find and replace within a single file or group of files, highlighting matched text and counting the number of matching strings.  Emacs also provides utilities that delete all lines or retain all lines containing a match, and aligning columns by a regex-defined delimiter.

\paragraph{System administration}
System administrators and power users rely on command-line utilities to accomplish complex computing tasks, often dealing with file names and the contents of configuration files.  The output of one utility can be used as the input for another utility using \emph{pipes}, and the mini-programs written using piped commands often rely on regular expressions to filter or transform strings in one step or another.  For example, {\tt grep} allows users to find strings that match a regex, and {\tt sed} provides a replace functionality.  The {\tt find} utility searches filenames based on a regex, and tools like {\tt git} and {\tt cron} use regexes written in configuration files (`.gitignore' and `crontab', respectively) to specify sets of files or sets of dates and times.

\paragraph{Searching fields in relational databases}
The popular SQL query language\todoLast{Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce} uses the `LIKE' operator and an exotic regular expression syntax (\verb!`%'! for zero-or-more repetition, \verb!`_'! to match any character, and typical character classes using brackets) to search fields for strings.  Modern relational database systems have expanded this syntax considerably with functions such as {\tt REGEXP\_LIKE} in Oracle, {\tt REGEXP} in MySQL, {\tt\$regex} in MongoDB and {\tt regexp\_replace} in PostrgreSQL.


\subsection{Research and industry applications}
\paragraph{Meta-programming}  Regular expressions are central to YACC and LEX, which are critical compiler tools for generating parsers used in the compilation process and lexing source files, respectively.  So here regex are used as a meta-programming language specifying the behavior of a parser.  Regular expressions have also been used for test case generation~\cite{Ghosh:2013:JAT:2486788.2486925, Galler:2014:STD:2683035.2683100, Anand:2013:OSM:2503903.2503991, Tillmann:2014:TAT:2642937.2642941},  and as specifications for string constraint solvers~\cite{Trinh:2014:SSS:2660267.2660372, hampi}.  Some data mining frameworks use regular expressions as queries (e.g., ~\cite{Begel:2010:CDE:1806799.1806821}).

\paragraph{Mission-critical domains}  Regexes are employed in MySQL injection prevention~\cite{Yeole:2011:ADT:1980022.1980229} and network intrusion detection~\cite{network}, and in more diverse applications like DNA sequencing alignment~\cite{1594922} or querying RDF data~\cite{Lee:2010:PSQ:1871871.1871877, Alkhateeb:2009:ESR:1540656.1540975}.  Efforts have also been made to expedite the processing of regular expressions on large bodies of text~\cite{Baeza-Yates:1996:FTS:235809.235810}.

\subsection{Composition and analysis tools}

\paragraph{Composition tools} Regular expression understandability has not been studied directly, though prior work has suggested that regexes are hard to read and understand since there are tens of thousands of bug reports related to regular expressions~\cite{Spishak:2012:TSR:2318202.2318207}.  Due in part to their common use across programming languages and how susceptible regexes are to error, many researchers and practitioners have developed tools to support more robust regex creation~\cite{Spishak:2012:TSR:2318202.2318207} or to allow visual debugging~\cite{Beck:2014:RVD:2591062.2591111}.

Tools have also been developed to make regexes easier to understand, and many are available online.  Some tools will, for example, highlight parts of regex patterns that match parts of strings as a tool to aid in comprehension.\footurl{https://regex101.com/}  Other tools allow users to compose regular expressions using natural language\footurl{https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/PHPVerbalExpressions}.  Building on the perspective that regexes are difficult to create, other research has focused on removing the human from the creation process by learning regular expressions from  text~\cite{Babbar:2010:CBA:1871840.1871848, Li:2008:REL:1613715.1613719}.

\paragraph{Analysis tools} Research tools like Hampi~\cite{hampi}, and Rex~\cite{rex}, and commercial tools like brics~\cite{brics} all support the use of regular expressions in various ways. Hampi was developed  in academia and uses regular expressions as a specification language for a constraint solver. Rex was developed by Microsoft Research and generates strings for regular expressions that can be used in  applications such as test case generation~\cite{Anand:2013:OSM:2503903.2503991, Tillmann:2014:TAT:2642937.2642941}. Brics is an open-source package that creates automata from regular expressions for manipulation and evaluation. Automata.Z3\footurl{https://github.com/AutomataDotNet/Automata} is one of a suite of tools developed by Microsoft to analyze regular expressions.
