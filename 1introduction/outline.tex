This thesis will begin by introducing fundamental concepts about regular expressions and nomenclature used.  This is followed by a detailed description of the Python Regular Expression features that will be examined in this thesis and a summary of historical milestones.  To convey the scope of impact that research into regular expressions has, a small survey of applications and research will be provided.  Armed with this overview, the main questions that this thesis will explore will be introduced, followed by a section on related exploratory work.  The next \todoLast{N} sections will detail the studies conducted to explore the research questions of this thesis.  Each of these sections will consist of a description of how the study was designed, followed by a presentation of results and a discussion of implications and opportunities for future work.
Each section describing an experiment may depend on the results of previous sections.  A final discussion will highlight the most important implications and opportunities for future work already presented, as well as any additional implications or future work not mentioned elsewhere.  After a conclusion summarizing everything that has been presented, an appendix of artifacts and a bibliography will complete the thesis.
