\section{Outline}

This thesis begins with an introduction detailing the main contributions, followed by a section on related work, touching on historical milestones and applications of regular expressions, as well as work on mining repositories and refactoring that has similarities to this work. The next chapter provides the formatting standards and terminology used in this thesis to aide in understanding.  Next, the five studies conducted to explore regular expression usage and refactoring are each presented with their own separate discussion section that focuses on the results that particular study.  Then a final discussion highlights the most important implications from each study, also presenting any implications gathered from the combination of results from multiple studies. Opportunities for future work are presented next, followed by a conclusion, an appendix of artifacts and a bibliography that completes this thesis.
