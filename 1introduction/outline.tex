\section{Outline}

\subsection{Sections of this thesis}
This thesis begins with a background section on the formatting standards and terminology used in this thesis to aide in understanding (Chapter~\ref{ch2}). Next is related work (Chapter~\ref{ch3}), touching on historical milestones and applications of regular expressions, as well as work on mining repositories and refactoring that has similarities to this work. Next, the five studies conducted to explore the five research questions are each presented with their own separate discussion section that focuses on the results that particular study in Chapter~\ref{ch4}.  Then a final discussion highlights the most important implications from each study in Chapter~\ref{ch5}, also presenting any implications gathered from the combination of results from multiple studies. Opportunities for future work are presented next in Chapter~\ref{sec:futureWork}, followed by a conclusion in Chapter~\ref{ch7}, and an appendix of artifacts in Appendices~\ref{ch8},~\ref{ch9},~\ref{ch10},~\ref{ch11} and ~\ref{ch12} and a bibliography.
