The contributions of this work are:
\begin{itemize} \setlength \itemsep{.1pt}
    \item An empirical analysis of regex feature usage in 13,597 regexes extracted from 1,645 open-source Python projects,
    \item A comparison of supported features across eight regular expression languages, as well as a comparison of features supported by four regular expression analysis tools,
    \item An approach for measuring behavioral similarity of regular expressions and qualitative analysis of the most common behaviorally similar clusters,
    %\item A manual categorization of regexes into N task categories, and a quantitative analysis of the...
    \item A survey of 18 professional software developers about their experience with regular expressions,
    \item Identification of equivalence classes for regular expressions with possible transformations within each class
    \item Conducted an empirical study identifying opportunities for regex refactoring in Python projects based on how regexes are expressed,
    \item Conducted an empirical study with 180 participants evaluating regex understandability,
    \item Identified preferred regex representations and refactorings for understandability and conformance to community standards, backed by empirical evidence, and
    \item An evidence-based discussion of opportunities for future work in supporting programmers who use regular expressions, including refactoring regexes, developing regex similarity analyses, and providing migration support between languages.
