\section{Contributions}

The contributions of this work are:
\begin{itemize} \setlength \itemsep{.1pt}
    \item An empirical analysis of regex feature usage in 13,597 regexes extracted from 1,645 open-source Python projects (Section~\ref{sec:featureResults}),
    \item A comparison of supported features across eight regular expression languages, as well as a comparison of features supported by four regular expression analysis tools (Section~\ref{sec:featureSupport}),
    \item An approach for measuring behavioral similarity of regular expressions(Section~\ref{sec:buildingSimilarity}), and qualitative analysis of clusters formed using that behavioral similarity measure (Section~\ref{sec:categoriesDefined}),
    \item A survey of 18 professional software developers about their habits, preferences and challenges using regular expressions (Section~\ref{sec:surveyResults}),
    \item Identification of equivalence classes for regular expressions with possible transformations within each class (Section~\ref{sec:equivClasses}),
    \item An empirical study of how frequently regexes are represented within equivalence classes, identifying refactoring opportunities based on these frequency measurements (Section~\ref{sec:nodeCountingResults}),
    \item An empirical study with 180 participants evaluating the understandability of representations within equivalence classes, identifying refactoring opportunities based on these understandability measurements (Section~\ref{sec:comprehensionResults}),
    \item An evidence-based discussion of opportunities for future work in supporting programmers who use regular expressions, including refactoring regexes based on a variety of metrics, providing regex search functionality, migration support between languages, and fundamental research extending the techniques pioneered in this work (Section~\ref{sec:futureWork}).
