\section{Contributions}

The contributions of this work are:
\begin{itemize} \setlength \itemsep{.1pt}
    \item A survey of 18 professional software developers about their experience with regular expressions,
    \item An empirical analysis of regex feature usage in nearly 14,000 regular expressions in \dbfetch{nProjScanned} open-source Python projects, mapping of those features to those supported by common regex tools and survey results showing the impact of not supporting various features,
    \item An approach for measuring behavioral similarity of regular expressions and qualitative analysis of the most common behaviorally similar clusters, and
    \item An evidence-based discussion of opportunities for future work in supporting programmers who use regular expressions, including refactoring regexes, developing regex similarity analyses, and providing migration support between languages.
\end{itemize}
