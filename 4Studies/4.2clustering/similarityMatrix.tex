\section{Similarity matrix creation}

\subsection{Implementation details}

In clustering the regular expressions, we are most interested in observing behavior of regexes found in multiple projects.  Starting with the 13,597 patterns of the corpus, we discarded 10,015 (74\%) patterns that were not found in multiple projects.
Then we excluded an additional 711 (5\%) patterns that contain features not supported by Rex.  We studied the remaining 2,871 (21\%) patterns using our similarity analysis technique. The impact is that 923 projects were excluded from the data set for the similarity analysis. Omitted features are indicated in Table~\ref{table:featureStats} for Rex.
