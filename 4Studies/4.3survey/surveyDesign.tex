When trying to assess how developers use regular expressions, input directly from developers is useful and relevant.  The goal of this section is to answer the question, `What preferences, behaviors and opinions do professional developers have about using regex?'.  Professional software developers at Dwolla, a startup company focused on moving money, were asked about their usage and preferences when using regular expressions.  The results of this survey indicate that developers use regular expressions most frequently in text editors and on the command line, have a strong preference for numbered over named backreferences, and about half of developers use online testing tools when composing regular expressions.

\subsection{Survey design}

The survey implemented to understand the context of when and how programmers use regular expressions contains 30 questions and was deployed using Google Forms.
All survey questions are in Appendix~\ref{app:surveyQuestions}. The survey is composed of self-qualifying questions, questions about contextual usage frequency (by task and by environment), feature usage, best practices (testing, and parsing HTML) and pain points.  Participation was voluntary and participants were entered in a lottery for a \$50 gift card.


\subsubsection{Participants}
The goal of the survey was to understand the practices of professional developers. Thus, the survey was deployed to 22 professional developers at Dwolla, a small software company that provides tools for online and mobile payment management. While this sample comes from a single company, Dwolla is a start-up and most of the developers worked previously for other software companies, and thus bring their past experiences with them. Surveyed developers have nine years of experience, on average, indicating the results may generalize beyond a single, small software company, but further study is needed.
