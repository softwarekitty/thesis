\subsubsection{Implications}
CG is more commonly used in patterns than the highest ranked feature (ADD) by a wide margin (over 8\%), even though they appear in similar numbers of projects.

The eight most commonly used features, ADD, CG, KLE, CCC, ANY, RNG, STR and END,
appear in over half the projects.

The WRD default was often modified by a few characters - why?

\paragraph{Use Of Backreferences}\todoLast{Think about the part of all regex that use any back-references and so are not representing regular languages (vs those that are).}

\subsubsection{Threats to validity}
not good enough corpus, human error in testing lang table
