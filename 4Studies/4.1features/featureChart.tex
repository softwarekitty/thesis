\section{Feature Descriptions}

\input{table/featureDescriptions}

This thesis will focus on the features and syntax described in Table~\ref{table:featureDescriptions}.  A detailed introduction to the functionality of these features as studied in this thesis is provided in this section*.  The features of Python Regular Expressions that we analyze fall into four categories:

\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
\item{Elements are individual characters, character classes and logical groups.  Elements can be operated on by operators.}
\item{Options fundamentally modify the behavior of the engine.}
\item{Repetition modifiers, implicit concatenation and logical OR are operators. The order of operations is described in Section~\ref{sec:orderOfOperations}}.
\item{Positions refer to a position between characters.  They make assertions about the string on one or both sides of their position.}
\end{enumerate}
