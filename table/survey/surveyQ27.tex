\hline
 &\textbf{What pain points have you encountered with regular expressions?}\\
\noalign{\hrule height 0.08em}
A &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} long ones can be hard to read\end{minipage}\\
\hline
B &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} \end{minipage}\\
\hline
C &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Maintainability. Readability by other developers.\end{minipage}\\
\hline
D &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} inconsistencies between implementations. Some regexes work differently (or don't work) in some languages.\end{minipage}\\
\hline
E &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} \end{minipage}\\
\hline
F &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Hard to read/debug. Easy to have edge cases.\end{minipage}\\
\hline
G &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} It's farther away from English than most of the programming languages I use.\end{minipage}\\
\hline
H &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Readability. Edge cases.\end{minipage}\\
\hline
I &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Differences in implementation across languages\end{minipage}\\
\hline
J &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Capturing too much information, behaving unexpectedly due to not thinking about all scenarios.\end{minipage}\\
\hline
K &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Hard to always remember best practices.  \end{minipage}\\
\hline
L &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Before I found the online tools, it was very difficult to write them since I've never read up on them. With the tools, I can usually hack something together.\end{minipage}\\
\hline
M &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Composition of multiple groups\end{minipage}\\
\hline
N & \begin{minipage}{5.2in}Not every system supports all the functionality of regex and knowing what is supported across various languages is tricky.

It is terrible to read (especially later after initial development) and expose what it was meant to do without very verbose method names.

Amazingly bad for long term maintenance, and they are often difficult to test for edge cases without being very careful or robust in your testing.  \end{minipage}\\
\hline
O &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} I don't use them often enough to have the syntax perfectly memorized. Sometimes there is trickiness to getting the expression right. Typically once they are written, especially by someone else, they can be difficult to interpret afterwords.\end{minipage}\\
\hline
P &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} certain cases they can get long and unwieldy for my meager brain.\end{minipage}\\
\hline
Q &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Creating the correct one to match the input\end{minipage}\\
\hline
R &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Learned the hard way that it should never be used for html. Also, readability is another big pain point. Almost always need to extract an intent revealing method. \end{minipage}\\
\hline
S &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} Can be hard to read after the fact\end{minipage}\\
\hline
T &\begin{minipage}{5.2in} I have trouble with forward and back references.  Regex has its place and may not be suitable for everything.\end{minipage}\\
