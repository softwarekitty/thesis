\begin{abstract}
Though regular expressions (regex) provide a powerful search technique that is baked into every major language, is incorporated into a myriad of essential tools, and has been a fundamental aspect of Computer Science since Thompson in 1968, no one has ever formally studied how they are used in practice, or how to address challenges in composition and comprehension.  This thesis presents the original work of studying a sample of regex taken from Python projects pulled from Github, determining what features are used most often, defining some categories that illuminate common use cases, and identifying areas of significance for tool builders.  Furthermore, this thesis defines an equivalence class model used to explore comprehension of regex, identifying the most common and most understandable representations of semantically identical regex, suggesting several refactorings and preferred representations.  Opportunities for future work include the novel and rich field of regex refactoring, semantic search of regexes, and further fundamental research into regex usage and understandability.
