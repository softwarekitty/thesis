\specialchapt{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}

I'd like to acknowledge Dr. Tien Nguyen for his encouragement of my early experiments with data mining and his jovial focus on the big picture.  I also must sincerely thank Dr. Samik Basu for providing a light-hearted and meaningful perspective - a steadying hand throughout the undergraduate and graduate experiences. Last but not least, I would like to thank and acknowledge Dr. Kathryn Stolee for convincing me to pursue graduate research, and for her many and substantial contributions to this work.  Her indomitable positivity, extraordinary enthusiasm for research, and generous spirit have nurtured me as a researcher, and taught me that it's better to get the whole thing done than to get a few parts of it perfect.
